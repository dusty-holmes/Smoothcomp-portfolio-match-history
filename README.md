# Smoothcomp AWS Data Engineering Project
Welcome to my project portfolio.  
This site showcases the architecture, AWS integrations, data models, and insights.

This project is a public facing repository to showcase the process for creating a data pipeline to process matches on Smoothcomp.com over the previous 5+ years.
